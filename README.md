# find_your_hat_game
This is a small terminal based game where you have to find a your hat (^) in a grid. It was a part of my codecademy course.

Features:
  -random generation of an array based on prompts from user
  -hidden obstacles for the user to avoid
  -a creation of the path travelled through the array

Learning points:
  -Using classes
  -Used a lot of conditionals and array manipulations
  -Took quite a bit of debugging due to small issues, such as adding holes into the generated array, but not getting rid of the fieldCharacters, and had to rethink how I was approaching the problem entirely

Overall it took me probably around 5 hours to complete, but a lot of that was back and forth just tidying things up. Happy with the outcome, think there are probably a lot of ways to approach the task

Areas I would improve:
  -I think my switch cases for the movement of the character is quite bulky, and so I think I would lok at simplying that area of the code potentially
  -I should probably have put my playGame function as a part of the field class, rather than running it as a separate function outside of the class
